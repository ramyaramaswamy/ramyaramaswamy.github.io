	<h1> Experiment with front end programming</h1>
	<h3> Trying out a para with styling </h3>
	This is my <em> first </em> attempt with <strong>html</strong>! <br/>
	I am writing a para and learning to use <strong> different </strong> elements <br/>
	It is recommended to use CSS for styling purposes 
	<h3> Adding few links </h3>
	<p> href says the website it has to point to. You can then use target_blank for making it open in a new window.<br/> Following this you have title which is the text displayed while hovering on it. Following that is the actual text</p>
	<a href="http://treehouse.com/" title="this displays when you hover on the link" target="_blank">Treehouse</a><br/>
