				<p>This is the  first trip for the summer season. We did it pretty good. Terrain kept changing from rocky roads to smooth trails. In less than a mile, we came across a picnic spot where people stopped to dip their feet in cold water or eat. After that we continued along to go to Keekwulee Falls which was a secretly hidden small falls. We spotted a lot of wild flowers (We named two varieties, White Papyrus and Purple Poo). We proceeded further and then realized that the final destination was way father than we thought it was. So we decided to turn back, had out victorywich at the Keekwulee falls and headed down. It was a such a great relief for our body after several months of sedentary lifestyle</p>

				<p>We hiked this on a very sunny and bright day. Few parts of the hike had steep inclines. But we continued to make our way up. The best part of the hike was the last one mile where it was all down hill. The view of the lake also started becoming much beautiful and clear. It was a beautiful view of the lake with a lot of high school kids swimming and having fun. We had our victorywich and started hiking down. We didn’t know that the hike went beyond the lake to cover the entire 7.2 miles. We met “Stella” the dog while coming down. But hey, one more step closer to John Muir.</p>

				<p>This was the longest hike we had done so far. Our hike started off with eating a real green apple that fell off a tree. The trail was super well maintained and smooth. It was not rocky unlike other hikes. All we had to do was slow and steadily climb up. San carried our supply bag all the way up and I carried it down. We sang all the way up to the top for the fear of encountering bears (Yes, we read in a recent trip summary report that a bear was spotted just two days back). The view from the top was spectacular. We had the entire view of Lake Washington, Bellevue through the paragliding area. Hike down was fun as we ran with (behind!) the trail runners.</p>
