			<h4>Take your Code to-go </h4>
			<p>Write code from your phone or tablet as efficiently as you would on your desktop with syntax highlighting, code folding, linter integration and a lot more </p>

		<div class="Typeless">
			<h4>Type Less, Get it Right </h4>
			<p> No need to type out every character. Superlime’s intelligent auto-complete for words and code-blocks will fill for you </p>
		</div>

		<div class="Portable">
			<h4>Don’t miss your 30’’ monitor</h4>
			<p>Superlime shows a summary of code near your edit. So you always have context without the need to see all the code</p>
		</div>

		<div class="Speak">
			<h4>Actions Speak</h4>
			<p>Gestures in Superlime are like keyboard-shortcuts. We have made sure you won’t miss your  Ctrl-f, Ctrl-p, Ctrl-n :%s, gg </p>

		<div class="Github">
			<h4>Integrated with Github</h4>
			<p>Edit any file you have on Github, view diffs and commit changes directly from your phone or tablet </p>

		<div class="Handoff">
			<h4>Seamless handoff</h4>
			<p>Start editing on your desktop, and finish it on your phone. Superlime’s desktop app syncs the state of your local repository (branches, commits, stash, changes, everything) with your phone and vice versa </p>
